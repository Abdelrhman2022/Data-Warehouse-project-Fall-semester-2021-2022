 # Dataset 
 
Bike-sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data for two major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago and New York City  generated by these systems make them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Therefore, Bike-sharing systems function as a sensor network, which can be used to study mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Chicago, D.C.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all two cities. All two of the data files contain the same core of eight (8) columns:

 -	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
 -	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
 -	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 -	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
 -	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 -	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
 -	Gender (Male, Female)
 -	Birth Year (1998, 1981)
