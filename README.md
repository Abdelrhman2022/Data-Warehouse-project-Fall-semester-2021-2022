Bike-sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data for two major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago and New York City  generated by these systems make them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Therefore, Bike-sharing systems function as a sensor network, which can be used to study mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Chicago, D.C.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all two cities. All two of the data files contain the same core of eight (8) columns:

 -	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
 -	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
 -	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 -	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
 -	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 -	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
 -	Gender (Male, Female)
 -	Birth Year (1998, 1981)

# SSIS Steps

1. Change the data type of any Dates you have to a string in addition to you should convert the format of any Dates you have to be in this format which is MM-DD-YYYY.
2. Apply some of string functions on any columns you want, and these functions are (Upper, Len, Left, Reverse) you must apply all of these functions.
3. Apply conditional split and you are free to choose any the condition you want to split data. All these point from 2,3,4 should be applied on the two files.
4. You should have one destination that contain two tables each table will have data that meet the condition.
5. Creating a Dashboard for only one destination table. Dashboard contains a multiple-type charts minimum four different types of visualization(charts).
